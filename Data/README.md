# Data
This folder contains sample data that I used and the instructional [Jupityer Notebook](https://github.com/ashera17/ENGL-105-Unit-3/blob/main/Data/Unit%203%20Project.ipynb) on how I isolated my data

This is the basic data that I used along with the main subset that I focused on in my analysis of the data.

The [CountyHealthData.csv](https://github.com/ashera17/ENGL-105-Unit-3/blob/main/CountyHealthData.csv) is the raw data (Not Present in the folder because the file is to large) and the [MergedData.csv](https://github.com/ashera17/ENGL-105-Unit-3/blob/main/Data/MergedData.csv) is the data I focused on.
