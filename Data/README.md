# Data
This folder contains sample data and subsets used for Python instructional modules.

This is the basic data that I used along with the main subset that I focused on in my analysis of the data.

The CountyHealthData.csv is the raw data (Not Present in the folder because the file is to large) and the MergedData.csv is the data I focused on.
