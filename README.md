# 105-Unit-3
This is a reporsitory containg instructional materials and sample datasets for Prof. Gotzler's Fall 2022 sections of ENGL-105 at the University of Carolina, Chapel Hill.

The repository contains 3 python notebooks: 
1. module on basic topics in coding with Python3.
2. module on getting started with the Pandas package.
3. module on using the Pandas package for data analysis.

These materials have been adapted from the excellent lessons created by the staff at the [Research Hub](https://library.unc.edu/data/) of UNC's Davis Library.

I chose the specific data I did because I wanted to learn about my own county. The CountyHealthData.csv contains every county from every state in the United States and it is very interesting to compare the different types of data.

This data is mostly for people who are new to Python and Pandas as it is a good way to get an introduction to using the software. With the simple datatset that can be interesting to anyone this repository is simply meant to show off the basic functions that can be used in Python and Pandas.

People can use this repository in order to learn more about Python and Pandas, and hopefully use this as a springboard into their future endeavors using these softwares.
